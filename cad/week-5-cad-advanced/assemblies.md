# Assemblies

## Joints

In **Fusion 360**, joints are used to define relationships between components, enabling you to simulate how they move relative to each other. Joints determine both **movement** and **degrees of freedom** (DOF) between parts, allowing you to create assemblies with realistic motion.

The table below summarises different joints and their **degrees of freedom** (DOF)

|     Type    |                                                Description                                               | Translation | Rotation | Motion Allowed                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|    Rigid    |           Locks two components together, ensuring that they stay fixed relative to each other.           |      0      |     0    | <p></p><p><strong>Rotational motion</strong>: None.</p><p><strong>Translational motion</strong>: None</p>                                                                                                                          |
|   Revolute  |                       Commonly used for hinges, such as a door or a rotating shaft.                      |      0      |     1    | <p></p><p><strong>Rotational motion</strong>: Around a single axis.</p><p><strong>Translational motion</strong>: None.</p>                                                                                                         |
|    Slider   |                             Useful for parts like pistons or drawer sliders.                             |      1      |     0    | <p></p><p><strong>Rotational motion</strong>: None.</p><p><strong>Translational motion</strong>: Along a single axis.</p>                                                                                                          |
| Cylindrical |           Ideal for screws or other parts where you need both sliding and rotational movement.           |      1      |     1    | <p></p><p><strong>Rotational motion</strong>: Around a single axis.</p><p><strong>Translational motion</strong>: Along that <strong>same</strong> axis.</p>                                                                        |
|   Pin-slot  |                   Parts that slide and rotate, like a pin moving in a slot or a track.                   |      1      |     1    | <p></p><p><strong>Rotational motion</strong>: Around a defined axis.</p><p><strong>Translational motion</strong>: Along a defined path or slot (not necessarily linear).</p>                                                       |
|    Planar   |   For parts that need free movement in a plane but restricted in height, such as sliders on a surface.   |      2      |     1    | <p></p><p><strong>Rotational motion</strong>: Around an axis <strong>perpendicular</strong> to the plane.</p><p><strong>Translational motion</strong>: Along two perpendicular axes within the plane (free motion in a plane).</p> |
|     Ball    | Used for joints that need multi-directional rotation, like a universal joint or a ball-and-socket joint. |      0      |     3    | <p></p><p><strong>Rotational motion</strong>: Around all axes (free rotation).</p><p><strong>Translational motion</strong>: None.</p>                                                                                              |
