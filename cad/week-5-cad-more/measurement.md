# Measurement

## Distance & Area

The quickest way to measure is to click on the **specific face** of the object. And then fusion 360 will tell you the **surface area / length** of the face / line you select.

{% hint style="info" %}
Usually we won't use the "Measurement" from the "Inspect" panel
{% endhint %}

## Volume

This is done by

1. Select Body (from Browser)
2. Right click "**Properties**"

## Center of Mass

This function takes in the input of an **object** and ths coordinates are stored in the "Analysis" folder.

{% hint style="info" %}
Usually, you can get coordinates of the center of mass by using [#volume](measurement.md#volume "mention") method. This method is to show the **center of mass** visually.
{% endhint %}

## Questions

In the figure below, the distance from the center of mass to the rotational axis (x-axis) is given by

$$
d=\sqrt{y^2+z^2}
$$

Which is around 0.186 mm.

## Tips

1. What's the difference between the center of mass and center of volumn?
