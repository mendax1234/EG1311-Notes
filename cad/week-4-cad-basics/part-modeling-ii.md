## Fusion 360 functions

### Chamfer

**Chamfer** is a feature used to create a beveled edge between two surfaces, typically at a corner. It removes the sharp edge and replaces it with a flat or angled surface. Chamfers are commonly used in design to soften edges, reduce sharpness for safety, or prepare parts for assembly.

For example, in this example, we are using the **equal distance** chamfer function.

### Fillet

**Fillet** is a feature used to create a rounded edge between two surfaces, typically at a corner or along an edge. It smooths out sharp edges by adding a curve, which can improve the appearance, reduce stress concentration, or make parts safer to handle.

### Arc

The **arc function** in Fusion 360 is a tool used to create curved lines or sections of circles in sketches, essential for designing rounded shapes or connecting elements with smooth curves. It is located under the "Create" column.

For example, if you want the **half circle** in the draft below, you can use the **arc** function to create one.

## 2-D Sketch

### Radius and Diameter

In Fusion 360, the **radius** in the sketch begins with **R** while the **diameter** begins with $$\phi$$.
