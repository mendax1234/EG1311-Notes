# Laser Cutting DXF

Basically, all what you need to know is that:

1. The DXF file for laser cutting is a **vector-based** file.
2. The DXF file is created by right-clicking the sketch file and click "Save as DXF File"
3. You should create a new sketch on the shape/outline of your file, which should contain ur shape/outline only.
